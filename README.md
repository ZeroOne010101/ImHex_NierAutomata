# ImHex_NierAutomata
A pattern file for the ImHex hex-editor to help decipher savefiles for the game NieR:Automata.

Note, that i am very inexperienced - both in the pattern language, and with deciphering binary data.
Because of this, some assumptions i have made may be incorrect.

Much of the work was taken from https://github.com/MysteryDash/NieR.Automata.Editor <-- much credit to them.
